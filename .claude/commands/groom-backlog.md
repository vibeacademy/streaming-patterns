Launch the agile-backlog-prioritizer agent to:
- Review the project board at https://github.com/orgs/vibeacademy/projects/3
- Analyze and prioritize tickets in the backlog
- Ensure tickets meet quality standards (clear descriptions, acceptance criteria, effort estimates)
- Move top-priority, well-defined tickets to the Ready column
- Identify gaps, dependencies, and blockers
- Ensure alignment with product roadmap and requirements
