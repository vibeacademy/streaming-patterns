🚀 Launching: Chain-of-Reasoning Pattern for AI UIs

If you're a React developer wondering "how do I build interfaces for AI features?" — this is for you.

THE PROBLEM
Traditional web development taught us clean patterns: click button → fetch data → render UI.

But AI products don't work that way. They:
→ Stream tokens in real-time
→ Show incremental reasoning
→ Require human-in-the-loop interactions
→ Handle validation and retry loops

Most frontend devs have strong fundamentals but lack these specific UX patterns.

THE SOLUTION
I've built an open-source streaming patterns library. First pattern is live: Chain-of-Reasoning.

What it does: Makes AI reasoning visible and interactive. Instead of showing just the final answer, users see each step the AI takes to reach its conclusion.

THE DEMO
Real-world scenario: AI planning a 2-week sprint for a project management tool.

Watch it analyze the backlog, estimate team capacity, and assign work — all with visible reasoning steps users can inspect, promote, or challenge.

WHAT'S INCLUDED
✅ Live interactive demo (no API key needed)
✅ Network Inspector showing every streaming event
✅ Annotated source code explaining the pattern
✅ Built with React + TypeScript
✅ Mock streams for deterministic learning

WHY THIS MATTERS
The career landscape is shifting fast. Frontend developers who can build sophisticated AI interfaces will have a huge advantage.

This isn't about learning ML or prompt engineering. It's about mastering the interface layer — the missing skill that blocks traditional web devs from participating in AI product development.

This is part of what we're building at Vibe Academy: helping people in career limbo due to rapid AI advances acquire the foundation skills needed to prosper in an AI-centered economy.

WHAT'S NEXT
This is pattern #1 of 7. New demo every 2 weeks:
→ Agent-Await-Prompt
→ Tabular Stream View
→ Multi-Turn Memory Timeline
→ Turn-Taking Co-Creation
→ Streaming Validation Loop
→ Schema-Governed Exchange

**Title**: `Chain-of-Reasoning: A streaming pattern for AI UIs (open source)`

**Body**:
```
Hey React devs! I built an educational demo showing how to handle streaming AI responses with visible reasoning steps.

**The Pattern**: Chain-of-Reasoning
Makes AI "thinking" visible and interactive. Instead of just showing a final answer, users see each reasoning step as it streams in.

**Demo Scenario**: AI planning a sprint for a PM tool
- Analyzes backlog priorities
- Estimates team capacity
- Assigns work to sprint
- Shows all reasoning before final plan

**Key Features**:
- Custom React hook (`useReasoningStream`) for stream processing
- TypeScript strict mode throughout
- Network inspector to see events in real-time
- Mock streams (no API key needed to learn)
- Annotated source code

**Tech Stack**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite

**Why I Built This**:
Traditional web dev patterns (CRUD, request-response) don't translate well to AI UX. I'm creating 7 streaming patterns to help React devs bridge that gap.

This is part of Vibe Academy — helping devs transition to AI-era frontend development.

**Links**:
- Live demo: [YOUR-URL]
- GitHub: [YOUR-REPO]

Would love your feedback on the code and UX!

This is pattern #1 of 7. Next up: Agent-Await-Prompt (human-in-the-loop interactions).

**Features**:
- Live interactive demo (sprint planning scenario)
- Network inspector showing all streaming events
- Annotated source code with explanations
- Mock streams so anyone can learn without API costs
- Built with React + TypeScript

**The Mission**:
Help traditional web devs (list-detail apps, REST APIs, request-response) learn how to build sophisticated AI interfaces.

You don't need to learn ML. You need to learn these new UX patterns.

**What's Coming**: 6 more patterns over the next few months
- Agent-Await-Prompt
- Tabular Stream View

#### r/SideProject

**Title**: `Streaming Patterns Library - Teaching frontend devs AI-era UX [open source]`

**Body**:
```
Hey everyone! Just launched pattern #1 of my AI streaming patterns library.

**The Project**: 7 interactive demos teaching React devs how to build UIs for AI features

**Pattern #1 (Live Now)**: Chain-of-Reasoning
- Makes AI thinking visible
- Shows reasoning steps as they stream in
- Interactive demo: AI planning a sprint
- Full source code with annotations

**Why This Exists**:
Lots of frontend devs with strong fundamentals are struggling to transition to AI product development. The gap isn't in AI knowledge — it's in knowing how to build interfaces for streaming, reasoning, validation loops, etc.

**Tech Stack**:
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite for build
- Mock streams (educational, deterministic)
- Deployed on Cloudflare Pages

**The Business Model**:
This is free top-of-funnel for Vibe Academy (career training for the AI economy). Goal is to get devs hooked on the demos, then convert some to paid courses.

**What I Learned**:
- Building in public creates accountability
- Educational content needs to be interactive (not just blog posts)
- Mock infrastructure is just as important as the UI patterns

**Metrics So Far**:
Just launched, so TBD! Goals:
- 100+ demo visitors first week
- 20+ GitHub stars
- 5+ newsletter mentions

**Next Steps**:
- Ship 6 more patterns (one every 2 weeks)
- Create video tutorials
- Build email list
- Maybe start a Discord community

Hi [Editor Name],

I've built an open-source library of streaming UX patterns specifically for React developers building AI features.

The first pattern is live: Chain-of-Reasoning — a pattern for making AI reasoning visible and interactive.

**Why this matters:**
Most React devs are comfortable with request-response patterns, but AI products require different UX patterns (streaming tokens, visible reasoning, validation loops, human-in-the-loop). There's not a lot of educational content bridging this gap.

**What's included:**
- Live interactive demo (sprint planning scenario)
- Network inspector showing all streaming events
- Annotated React + TypeScript source code
- Mock streams so developers can learn without API costs

**Tech details:**
- Built with React 18, TypeScript (strict mode), Vite
- Custom hooks for stream processing
- All client-side, deployable on Cloudflare Pages

**The bigger picture:**
This is pattern #1 of 7 I'm building at Vibe Academy to help developers transition to AI-era frontend development. New pattern every 2 weeks.

Thought it might be relevant for React Newsletter readers.

### JavaScript Weekly / Frontend Focus

**Subject**: `Streaming UX patterns for AI interfaces (React + TypeScript)`

**Body**:
```
Hi [Editor Name],

I've created an open-source educational resource for frontend developers learning to build AI interfaces.

**The resource:** Interactive demos of streaming UX patterns with annotated source code

**First pattern live:** Chain-of-Reasoning
Shows how to make AI reasoning visible and interactive (vs. hiding it in a black box).

**Key features:**
- Live demo: AI planning a sprint with visible reasoning steps
- Network inspector: See every streaming event in real-time
- Annotated source: React + TypeScript with educational comments
- Mock infrastructure: Learn without needing API keys

**Why I built this:**
The frontend landscape is shifting with AI, but most educational content focuses on ML/prompting. Very few resources teach the *interface patterns* for streaming, reasoning, validation, etc.

This fills that gap for React/frontend developers.

**Tech stack:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, all client-side

Thought it might interest your readers. Happy to provide any additional context!

# Building Chain-of-Reasoning UX: A Guide for React Developers

## Introduction

AI is eating software. But most frontend developers don't know how to build AI interfaces.

Not because they can't learn AI. Because nobody's teaching the *interface patterns*.

This guide introduces Chain-of-Reasoning: a streaming UX pattern that makes AI thinking visible and interactive.

[Live Demo] | [GitHub]

---

## The Problem: Black Box AI

Traditional AI tools show you the answer, not the thinking.

User asks: "Plan my sprint"
AI responds: "Here's your sprint plan: [wall of text]"

Problems:
- Users don't know *how* the AI decided
- Errors are hidden until it's too late
- No ability to course-correct mid-stream
- Low trust in the output

---

## The Solution: Chain-of-Reasoning

Make the AI's reasoning visible as it streams in.

User asks: "Plan my sprint"

AI shows:
1. 🔄 Analyzing backlog priorities...
2. 🔄 Estimating team capacity...
3. 🔄 Matching work to capacity...
4. ✅ Final plan ready

Benefits:
- Users follow the logic in real-time
- Can catch errors early ("wait, wrong team size")
- Can promote good reasoning ("yes, prioritize that!")
- Higher trust in final output

---

## The Demo: Sprint Planning

[Screenshot of demo]

Scenario: AI planning a 2-week sprint for StreamFlow PM (a fictional project management tool).

The AI:
1. Reviews 24 backlog items
2. Estimates team capacity (5 devs × 2 weeks)
3. Assigns high-priority items to sprint
4. Shows reasoning for each decision

Users see each step appear as a "reasoning bead" before the final plan.

**Try it live:** [DEMO-URL]

---

## How It Works: The Code

### 1. Define the Event Types

```typescript
// types.ts
interface ReasoningStep {
  id: string;
  summary: string;
  confidence: number;
  timestamp: number;
}

type StreamEvent =
  | { type: 'reasoning'; data: ReasoningStep }
  | { type: 'answer'; data: { text: string } }
```

### 2. Create a Mock Stream

```typescript
// mockStream.ts
export async function* createMockReasoningStream(
  prompt: string
): AsyncGenerator<StreamEvent> {
  const events = [
    {
      type: 'reasoning',
      data: {
        id: '1',
        summary: 'Analyzing backlog priorities',
        confidence: 0.9,
        timestamp: Date.now()
      }
    },
    // ... more events
  ];

  for (const event of events) {
    await delay(300); // Simulate network latency
    yield event;
  }
}
```

### 3. Build a Custom Hook

```typescript
// hooks.ts
export function useReasoningStream(prompt: string) {
  const [reasoning, setReasoning] = useState<ReasoningStep[]>([]);
  const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    let cancelled = false;

    (async () => {
      const stream = createMockReasoningStream(prompt);

      for await (const event of stream) {
        if (cancelled) break;

        if (event.type === 'reasoning') {
          setReasoning(prev => [...prev, event.data]);
        } else if (event.type === 'answer') {
          setAnswer(event.data.text);
        }
      }
    })();

    return () => { cancelled = true };
  }, [prompt]);

  return { reasoning, answer };
}
```

### 4. Render the UI

```tsx
// ChainOfReasoningDemo.tsx
export function ChainOfReasoningDemo() {
  const { reasoning, answer } = useReasoningStream(
    'Plan a 2-week sprint for StreamFlow PM'
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Sprint Planning AI</h1>

      {/* Reasoning beads */}
      <div className="reasoning-beadline">
        {reasoning.map((step, i) => (
          <div key={step.id} className="bead">
            <span className="number">{i + 1}</span>
            <span className="summary">{step.summary}</span>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      {/* Final answer */}
      {answer && (
        <div className="answer">
          <h2>Sprint Plan</h2>
          <pre>{answer}</pre>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Key Implementation Details

### TypeScript Strict Mode
No `any` types. Ever.

Forces you to model your stream events properly, which makes debugging easier and prevents runtime errors.

### Mock Streams First
Build with mocks, not real LLM APIs.

Why?
- Deterministic (same input = same output)
- Fast iteration (no API latency)
- No costs while learning
- Easy to test edge cases

### Network Inspector
Every demo includes a network inspector showing all streaming events.

Essential for:
- Understanding how streams work
- Debugging your own implementations
- Learning the pattern internals

---

## Real-World Use Cases

This pattern works for any scenario where users need to trust AI output:

**Sprint Planning** (shown in demo)
- AI analyzes backlog
- Shows reasoning about priorities
- Users validate before committing

**Code Review Assistant**
- AI reviews PR
- Shows reasoning about each issue found
- Developers see why each suggestion was made

**Research Analysis**
- AI analyzes papers
- Shows reasoning about key findings
- Researchers verify logic before trusting conclusions

**Legal Document Review**
- AI reviews contract
- Shows reasoning about potential issues
- Lawyers see the analysis process

---
