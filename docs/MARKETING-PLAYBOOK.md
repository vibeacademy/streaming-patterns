🧠 New: Chain-of-Reasoning Pattern (Live Demo)

Most AI tools hide their thinking. This pattern makes it visible and interactive.

**Thread Template** (5-7 tweets):
```
1/ Frontend devs: AI is changing our job.

Not because AI will replace us, but because users now expect streaming, real-time, "thinking" UIs.

Here's how to build one: 🧵

2/ The problem: Traditional web dev is request → response → render.

AI UX is different. Tokens stream in. Reasoning happens incrementally. Users need to see progress.

3/ Introducing: Chain-of-Reasoning

Shows each step the AI takes before giving a final answer.

Users can:
→ Follow the logic
→ Catch errors early
→ Promote reasoning steps

[GIF]

4/ Built with React hooks + TypeScript.

The key: treating streams as first-class citizens, not afterthoughts.

Mock streams included so you can learn without API costs.

5/ What makes this educational:

→ Network Inspector shows every event
→ Annotated source code explains patterns
→ Real-world demo (sprint planning tool)
→ Copy-paste ready

6/ This is pattern #1 of 7.

Next: Agent-Await-Prompt (human-in-the-loop UX)

Building these at @vibeacademy to help devs transition to the AI era.

7/ Try the live demo: [link]

Explore the code: [GitHub]

Follow for more patterns dropping weekly 🚀
```

**Quote Tweet Your Own Demo**:
```
The Network Inspector is my favorite part 👀

Watch EVERY streaming event in real-time.

Perfect for debugging and learning how these patterns actually work.

🚀 Launching: Streaming Patterns for AI-Era Frontend Development

If you're a React developer wondering how to build UIs for AI features, this is for you.

**The Challenge:**
Traditional web development taught us request-response patterns. Click button → fetch data → render.

But AI products work differently. They stream tokens, show reasoning, handle validation loops, and require human-in-the-loop interactions.

**The Solution:**
I've open-sourced 7 streaming UX patterns with live demos, annotated code, and real-world examples.

**Pattern #1: Chain-of-Reasoning**
Makes AI thinking visible and interactive. See each reasoning step before the final answer.

✅ Live demo with mock streams (no API key needed)
✅ Network Inspector shows every event
✅ Annotated source code
✅ Built with React + TypeScript

**Why This Matters:**
The gap isn't in AI knowledge—it's in interface patterns. Frontend devs with strong fundamentals just need to learn these new UX building blocks.

This is part of the curriculum we're building at Vibe Academy to help developers thrive in an AI-centered economy.
